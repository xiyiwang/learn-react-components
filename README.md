# learn-react-components

This is a simple demo webpage created during my study of PluralSight's [Designing React Components class by Peter Kellner](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/5ec6c284-a3af-45b9-9f63-318d682ca3a2).

Packages used for creating this project include:

- REACT.js
- react-simple-img
- NEXT.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios
- JSON Server
- recompose
- react-notifications-component
